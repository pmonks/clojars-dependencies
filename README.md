# clojars-dependencies

A little tool for exploring the dependencies between projects deployed to Clojars.

## Installation

For now the script isn't deployed anywhere, so best to clone this repo, then take a look at the source.

If you've installed the [Clojure CLI tools](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started#_clojure_installer_and_cli_tools) you can run the sample script and be dropped in a REPL via:

```shell
$ clj -i repl-init.clj -r
```

Note that the first time this script is run it will pull down approximately 950MB of POMs from clojars.org (using `rsync`), which can take 10 or more minutes depending on your network connection.

On every run, the script parses all of those XML files (approximately 180,000 of them, as of mid-2019), which also takes quite a bit of time.  Look at the source for more details on what the script sets up for you to experiment with.
